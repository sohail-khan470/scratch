1. User Model
This represents the users in your system.

prisma
Copy
Edit
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())  // Unique identifier for the user (UUID)
  email     String   @unique               // Email address (must be unique)
  password  String                           // Hashed password for authentication
  roleId    String                          // Foreign key linking to Role model
  role      Role     @relation(fields: [roleId], references: [id]) // Relationship with Role
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())        // Timestamp when the user was created
}
Explanation
id: Unique identifier for each user (UUID).
email: Each user must have a unique email.
password: Stores a hashed password (for authentication).
roleId: Foreign key pointing to the Role table.
role: Relationship with Role (each user has a single role).
createdAt: Default timestamp when the user is created.
Example Data
id	email	password	roleId	createdAt
1	user@email.com	hashed_pw	1	2025-03-04
2	admin@email.com	hashed_pw	2	2025-03-04
2. Role Model
This table stores the different user roles (e.g., admin, user).

prisma
Copy
Edit
model Role {
  id          String       @id @default(uuid()) // Unique identifier for role
  name        String       @unique             // Role name (admin, user, etc.)
  users       User[]                            // Relationship: a role has multiple users
  permissions Permission[] @relation("RolePermission") // Many-to-many relation with Permissions
}
Explanation
id: Unique identifier for each role.
name: Unique name for the role (admin, user, etc.).
users: A role can have many users (one-to-many relation).
permissions: Many-to-many relationship with Permission.
Example Data
id	name
1	admin
2	user
3. Permission Model
This table defines actions that users with roles can perform (e.g., create, update, delete).

prisma
Copy
Edit
model Permission {
  id     String  @id @default(uuid()) // Unique identifier for permission
  name   String  @unique             // Permission name (create, update, delete, etc.)
  roles  Role[]  @relation("RolePermission") // Many-to-many relation with Role
}
Explanation
id: Unique identifier for each permission.
name: Unique permission name (create, update, delete, etc.).
roles: Many-to-many relationship with Role (a role can have multiple permissions, and a permission can belong to multiple roles).
Example Data
id	name
1	create
2	update
3	delete
Relationships Between Models
User â†” Role (One-to-Many)
One role can be assigned to many users.
A user can have only one role.
Role â†” Permission (Many-to-Many)
A role can have multiple permissions.
A permission can belong to multiple roles.
This relationship is implemented using the RolePermission relation in Prisma.

Real-World Example
Let's say we have the following setup:

User John (id=1) is an admin.
User Alex (id=2) is a normal user.
Admins can create, update, and delete.
Users can only read.
Table Representation
Users Table
id	email	password	roleId
1	john@email.com	hashed_pw	1
2	alex@email.com	hashed_pw	2
Roles Table
id	name
1	admin
2	user

Role-Permission Relation
roleId	permissionId
1 (admin)	1 (create)
1 (admin)	2 (update)

Conclusion
âœ… Users are assigned a single role.
âœ… Roles define what permissions users have.
âœ… Permissions define what actions users can perform.

This schema provides a flexible, scalable role-based authentication system that can be expanded as needed.

Detailed Explanation of the Prisma Schema
The schema defines four models: User, Role, UserRole (join table), and Permission. The goal is to support many-to-many relationships between users and roles, allowing a user to have multiple roles and a role to be assigned to multiple users.

1. User Model
prisma
Copy
Edit
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())  // Unique identifier (UUID)
  email     String   @unique               // Unique email for the user
  password  String                           // Hashed password
  roles     UserRole[]                      // Many-to-Many relation via UserRole table
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())        // Timestamp of user creation
}
Explanation:
id: Unique identifier (UUID format).
email: Unique for each user, used for login.
password: Stores the hashed password for authentication.
roles: A user can have multiple roles, stored in the UserRole join table.
createdAt: Timestamp when the user is created.
Example Data
id	email	password	createdAt
1	user@email.com	hashed_pw	2025-03-04
2	admin@email.com	hashed_pw	2025-03-04
2. Role Model
prisma
Copy
Edit
model Role {
  id          String       @id @default(uuid())  // Unique identifier
  name        String       @unique              // Role name (e.g., "admin", "user")
  users       UserRole[]                          // Many-to-Many relation via UserRole
  permissions Permission[] @relation("RolePermission") // Many-to-Many with Permissions
}
Explanation:
id: Unique identifier for each role.
name: A role name like "admin", "moderator", "user", etc.
users: Defines a many-to-many relationship with User through the UserRole join table.
permissions: Many-to-many relationship with Permission (a role can have multiple permissions).
Example Data
id	name
1	admin
2	user
3. UserRole Model (Join Table)
This table connects users and roles in a many-to-many relationship.

prisma
Copy
Edit
model UserRole {
  userId String
  roleId String
  user   User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  role   Role @relation(fields: [roleId], references: [id])
  @id(fields: [userId, roleId]) // Composite primary key
}
Explanation:
userId: Foreign key pointing to User.
roleId: Foreign key pointing to Role.
@id(fields: [userId, roleId]): Composite primary key, ensuring a user can have a role only once.
Example Data
userId	roleId
1	1
1	2
2	2
4. Permission Model
prisma
Copy
Edit
model Permission {
  id     String  @id @default(uuid())   // Unique identifier
  name   String  @unique                // Permission name (e.g., "create", "update")
  roles  Role[]  @relation("RolePermission") // Many-to-Many relation with Role
}
Explanation:
id: Unique identifier for the permission.
name: Defines a permission like "create", "update", "delete", etc.
roles: Many-to-many relation with Role (a permission can be assigned to multiple roles).
Example Data
id	name
1	create
2	update
3	delete
Many-to-Many Relationships in Action
User	Roles	Permissions
John (userId: 1)	Admin, User	Admin â†’ Create, Update, Delete
User â†’ Read
Alex (userId: 2)	User	Read
This structure allows for flexible role assignment without modifying the User or Role models.

Database Migration
Run:

sh
Copy
Edit
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_users_roles_m2m
This updates the database to match the new schema.

How Users are Assigned Multiple Roles
When a new user registers, they can have multiple roles.

js
Copy
Edit
app.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
    const { email, password, roleNames } = req.body;

    const roles = await prisma.role.findMany({ where: { name: { in: roleNames } } });
    if (!roles.length) return res.status(400).json({ message: "Invalid roles" });

    const hashedPassword = require('bcryptjs').hashSync(password, 10);

    const user = await prisma.user.create({
        data: { 
            email, 
            password: hashedPassword, 
            roles: {
                create: roles.map(role => ({ roleId: role.id }))
            }
        }
    });

    res.json(user);
});
How It Works
User provides email, password, and role names (["admin", "user"]).
Finds matching roles in the Role table.
Hashes password for security.
Creates a new user and assigns roles through the UserRole table.
Middleware for Role-Based Access
To restrict access, we use middleware to check if a user has the necessary permissions.

js
Copy
Edit
const checkPermission = (permission) => {
    return async (req, res, next) => {
        const userId = req.user?.id;
        if (!userId) return res.status(403).json({ message: "Unauthorized" });

        const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
            where: { id: userId },
            include: { roles: { include: { role: { include: { permissions: true } } } } }
        });

        if (!user) return res.status(403).json({ message: "User not found" });

        const hasPermission = user.roles.some(userRole => 
            userRole.role.permissions.some(perm => perm.name === permission)
        );
        
        if (!hasPermission) return res.status(403).json({ message: "Permission denied" });

        next();
    };
};
Protected Routes Example
js
Copy
Edit
app.post('/create', checkPermission("create"), (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: "Created successfully!" });
});

app.put('/update', checkPermission("update"), (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: "Updated successfully!" });
});

app.delete('/delete', checkPermission("delete"), (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: "Deleted successfully!" });
});
How It Works
User tries to access a route (POST /create).
Middleware checks if user has "create" permission.
If they do, request continues. Otherwise, access is denied.
